   * Creates particles.

   * @param name Specifies the particle to create.
   *
   * @param pos Specifies the position at which to create the particle. If not specified, defaults to the position of the executor.
   *
   * @param delta
   * Specifies the size of the 3-dimensional cuboid volume to spawn particles in, centered on position `pos`, and multiplied by about 8 (using 1 1 1 specifies a cuboid of about 8×8×8 in size).
   * Negative values may be used, but have the same effect as their positive counterparts (using -1 -1 -1 still equates to an 8×8×8 cuboid).
   *
   * Note that the generated particles aren't evenly distributed over the cuboid, instead it uses a Gaussian distribution resulting in a particle-gradient most dense at the center.
   * Tilde and caret notation may be used, the resulting coordinates are then used as delta.
   *
   * - Exception 1: When `name` is entity_effect or ambient_entity_effect, a `count` of 0 causes the `delta` and `speed` to act like RGBE values instead, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
   *   The three `delta` values give red, green, and blue components for the color; the `speed` provides an exponent that makes the colors brighter or dimmer, with 128 being a default.
   * - Exception 2: When `count` is set to 0, the `delta` instead acts as motion values for the particle, with `speed` acting as a multiplier.
   *   `dx`, `dy` and `dz` instead becomes `motion:x`, `motion:y` and `motion:z` respectively. Particles that don't have any motion to begin with are not affected by this (Example: barrier).
   * - Exception 3: When `name` is note, a `count` of 0 causes `dx` to act as a color modifier, with `speed` acting as a multiplier.
   *   Starts at green with the hue moving backward as this increments.
   *
   * @param speed Specifies the speed of the particle. Does not work on all particles (Example: `angry_villager`).
   *
   * @param count Specifies the number of particle effects to create. If 0, it results in a single particle.
   * See the exceptions on `delta` for why having a <count> of 0 can be useful.
   *
   * @param mode Specifies the display mode: `normal` or `force`.
   * Setting `force` allows the particle(s) to be seen up to 256 blocks away and by players that use the minimal particles setting.
   *
   * @param viewers Allows control of which player should view this particle instead of everyone in the viewing range of the particle.
