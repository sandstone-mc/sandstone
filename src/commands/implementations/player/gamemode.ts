   * 
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // Change your own gamemode
   * gamemode('creative')
   * 
   * // Target specific players
   * gamemode('survival', '@a')           // All players to survival
   * gamemode('creative', '@p')           // Nearest player to creative  
   * gamemode('spectator', 'PlayerName')  // Specific player to spectator
   * 
   * // Conditional gamemode changes
   * gamemode('adventure', '@a[tag=mapPlayer]')  // Players with specific tag
   * gamemode('creative', '@a[gamemode=survival]') // Only survival players
   * 
   * // Using numeric IDs (alternative syntax)
   * gamemode('1', '@p')  // Creative mode using numeric ID
   * ```
